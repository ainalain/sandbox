This is my pet project for experiments with front-end technologies and libraries and also a demo repository for my articles.

## Available Scripts

Run `yarn` and `yarn start` for a dev mode.

(You can also use `npm install` and `npm start` as your node scripts.)

The page will reload if you make edits.

## Purpose and features

`Master` branch currently contains a basic React-Redux SPA written on Typescript.

Please note that mostly this project works only in a development mode. This is not a production ready project. However, I will be glad to know that it helped you in some way.

Feel free to fork it or to use some pieces of its code in your projects.
